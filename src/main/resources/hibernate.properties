## Properties in this file are intended for use with the hibernate3-maven-plugin:hbm2ddl
## goal, but they aren't currently working.  The ApplicationContextConnectionProvider
## is designed to allow jasypt-encrypted properties to function propertly with the
## hbm2ddl goal, but for some reason doesn't.  The hbm2ddl goal works properly with
## unencrypted properties.

#hibernate.connection.provider_class=org.jasig.portlet.attachment.hibernate.ApplicationContextConnectionProvider
